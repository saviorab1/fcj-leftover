With AWS Amplify initialized and deployed, we now need to integrate frontend components and backend services. In this section, we'll install necessary dependencies, configure authentication, and set up the application's user interface and data layer.

#### Install Dependencies and Setup Frontend

1. Install AWS Amplify libraries and UI components.
2. Configure CSS styling for the application interface.
3. Set up the basic frontend structure and layout.

#### Configure Authentication and Backend

1. Implement Amplify Authenticator for user authentication.
2. Configure the main application component with Amplify integration.
3. Set up authentication flow and user interface components.

#### Setup Amplify Data Schema

1. Create and configure the Amplify data resource.
2. Define the data schema and authorization modes.
3. Set up API key authentication for data access.
