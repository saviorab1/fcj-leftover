AWS Amplify Sandbox provides an isolated development environment that allows developers to rapidly test and integrate AWS services. In this section, we'll configure AWS credentials and deploy a sandbox environment for local development and testing.

#### Configure AWS Credentials

1. Set up AWS CLI configuration with SSO authentication.
2. Configure the amplify-admin profile for sandbox access.
3. Authorize and verify the SSO connection.

#### Deploy Sandbox Environment

1. Deploy the Amplify sandbox with the configured profile.
2. Generate the amplify_outputs.json configuration file.
3. Test the local development environment with authentication.
