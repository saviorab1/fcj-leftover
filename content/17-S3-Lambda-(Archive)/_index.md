## Build The Website Frontend

For this project, we have created our own custom logo simply just for aesthetic reason, you can drop in your own logo or remove it entirely.

1. Create another folder inside **src** folder, create a folder to store the pictures inside the newlymade folder, and put the images inside. 

2. Adjust the App.tsx, App.css and index.css file to match the design you desire.

## Build the S3

You will also need to create a bucket for storage. The steps are basics.

## Build the Lambda Function

To create Lambda, you will need to:

1. Set up IAM role for Lambda.

2. Create Lambda function for data collection.
