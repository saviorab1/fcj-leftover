Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool that provides fast development server and optimized builds. In this section, we'll set up a React + TypeScript project using Vite for our leftover ingredients application.

#### Create Vite Project

1. Initialize a new Vite project with React and TypeScript template.
2. Configure the project structure and dependencies.
3. Verify the project scaffolding is complete.

#### Run Development Server

1. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies.
2. Start the development server with hot module replacement.
3. Access the application and verify it's running correctly.
