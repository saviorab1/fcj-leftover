Amazon API Gateway enables you to create RESTful APIs that act as a front door for your Lambda functions. By setting up a data collection API, you can capture user interactions and ingredient inputs for analytics and optimization purposes.

This REST API will collect user data including ingredients, timestamps, and session information to help analyze usage patterns and improve the recipe generation experience.

#### Create REST API

1. Navigate to API Gateway console and create a new REST API.
2. Configure the API with appropriate naming and endpoint settings.
3. Set up the foundational API structure for data collection.

#### Configure API Resources and Methods

1. Create the `/collect-data` resource with CORS enabled.
2. Add a POST method integrated with the Lambda data collector function.
3. Configure Lambda proxy integration for seamless data handling.

#### Enable CORS and Deploy API

1. Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for web browser compatibility.
2. Configure proper headers for secure cross-origin requests.
3. Deploy the API to a stage for production use.

#### Integrate API with Frontend

1. Update the React application to include data collection functionality.
2. Implement user session tracking and ingredient logging.
3. Configure API endpoint integration with error handling.

{{% notice tip %}}
The API Gateway URL will be generated after deployment and needs to be manually updated in your frontend code to establish the connection between your application and the data collection service.
