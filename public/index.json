	"content": "Creating your first AWS account Overview In this first lab, you will be creating your new AWS account and use Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to improve your account security. Next, you will create an Administrator Group and Admin User to manage access to resources in your account instead of using the root user. Finally, we will step through account authentication with AWS Support in the event you experience authentication problems.\nAWS Account An AWS account is the basic container for all the AWS resources you can create as an AWS customer. By default, each AWS account will have a root user. The root user has full access within your AWS account, and root user permissions cannot be limited. When you first create your AWS account, you will be assessing it as the root user.\nAs a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it\u0026rsquo;s not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access. Thereafter, the users in the administrators user group should set up the user groups, users, and so on, for the AWS account. All future interaction should be through the AWS account\u0026rsquo;s users and their own keys instead of the root user. However, to perform some account and service management tasks, you must log in using the root user credentials.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services.\nIAM User Group An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group.\nIAM User An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. Please note that an IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.\nAWS Support AWS Basic Support offers all AWS customers access to our Resource Center, Service Health Dashboard, Product FAQs, Discussion Forums, and Support for Health Checks – at no additional charge. Customers who desire a deeper level of support can subscribe to AWS Support at the Developer, Business, or Enterprise level.\nCustomers who choose AWS Support gain one-on-one, fast-response support from AWS engineers. The service helps customers use AWS\u0026rsquo;s products and features. With pay-by-the-month pricing and unlimited support cases, customers are freed from long-term commitments. Customers with operational issues or technical questions can contact a team of support engineers and receive predictable response times and personalized support.\nMain Content Creating a new AWS Account Setting up MFA for the AWS Account root user Creating an Administrator Accounts and Groups Getting support for Account Authentication "

Copy permissions: Copy permissions from an existing user with similar needs. Attach policies directly: Attach AWS managed or custom policies directly to the user.

These steps cannot be performed as an IAM user or a role.\nUse the email address and password of your AWS account to sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.\nIn the top-right corner of the console, select your account name or number, then choose \u0026ldquo;Security Credentials\u0026rdquo;.\nUnder \u0026ldquo;Access keys,\u0026rdquo; select \u0026ldquo;Create access key.\u0026rdquo; If this option is unavailable, it means you have the maximum number of access keys. You must delete one of the existing access keys before creating a new one. For more information, see IAM Object Quotas in the IAM User Guide.\nOn the \u0026ldquo;Alternatives to root user access keys\u0026rdquo; page, consider security recommendations. To proceed, check the box and then select \u0026ldquo;Create access key.\u0026rdquo;\nOn the \u0026ldquo;Retrieve access key\u0026rdquo; page, your Access Key ID will be displayed.\nUnder the \u0026ldquo;Secret access key\u0026rdquo; section, select \u0026ldquo;Show,\u0026rdquo; then copy the Access Key ID and Secret Key from your browser window and paste them into a secure location.

Keep the file in a secure location.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Done.\u0026rdquo; When you no longer need the access key, we recommend either deleting it or at least considering disabling it to prevent misuse.\nNote: These steps apply only to the root user account on AWS. For IAM users or roles, the process of creating and managing access keys may differ.\nRevoking Access Key for Root User on AWS Minimum Permissions To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions:\nYou must be logged in as the root user of your AWS account, this does not require any additional AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. You cannot perform these steps as an IAM user or a role. Use the email address and password of your AWS account to sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. In the top-right corner of the console, select your account name or number, then choose Security Credentials. Under Access keys, select the access key you wish to delete, then in the Actions section, choose Delete. Note Alternatively, you can choose to Deactivate an access key instead of permanently deleting it. This allows you to continue using it in the future without changing both the key ID and secret key. While the key is deactivated, any requests using it in AWS API requests will fail with an \u0026ldquo;access denied\u0026rdquo; error.\nIn the Delete dialog, select Deactivate, enter the access key ID to confirm your intention to delete it, then choose Delete.\n"
