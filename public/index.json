	"content": "Creating your first AWS account Overview In this first lab, you will be creating your new AWS account and use Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to improve your account security. Next, you will create an Administrator Group and Admin User to manage access to resources in your account instead of using the root user. Finally, we will step through account authentication with AWS Support in the event you experience authentication problems.\nAWS Account An AWS account is the basic container for all the AWS resources you can create as an AWS customer. By default, each AWS account will have a root user. The root user has full access within your AWS account, and root user permissions cannot be limited. When you first create your AWS account, you will be assessing it as the root user.\nAs a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it\u0026rsquo;s not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access. Thereafter, the users in the administrators user group should set up the user groups, users, and so on, for the AWS account. All future interaction should be through the AWS account\u0026rsquo;s users and their own keys instead of the root user. However, to perform some account and service management tasks, you must log in using the root user credentials.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services.\nIAM User Group An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group.\nIAM User An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. Please note that an IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.\nAWS Support AWS Basic Support offers all AWS customers access to our Resource Center, Service Health Dashboard, Product FAQs, Discussion Forums, and Support for Health Checks – at no additional charge. Customers who desire a deeper level of support can subscribe to AWS Support at the Developer, Business, or Enterprise level.\nCustomers who choose AWS Support gain one-on-one, fast-response support from AWS engineers. The service helps customers use AWS\u0026rsquo;s products and features. With pay-by-the-month pricing and unlimited support cases, customers are freed from long-term commitments. Customers with operational issues or technical questions can contact a team of support engineers and receive predictable response times and personalized support.\nMain Content Creating a new AWS Account Setting up MFA for the AWS Account root user Creating an Administrator Accounts and Groups Getting support for Account Authentication "

To find the link, you will once again click on Model Catalog -\u0026gt; Choose Anthropic on Filter and click on Claude Sonnet 3.5 or the model that you have chosen.\nScroll down or search around. Some models such as Karakuri or Liquid will have their own line of Model ARN and all user has to do is copy that line to resources.\nHowever, since we do not have that luxury with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we have to be smart about the approach. First off, we have to change to the correct region for the ARN then copy the Model ID to replace the one at the end of that line.\nTo grant permission for each models, you have to update the corresponding ARN in the PolicyStatement.\nGo to amplify/data folder and create a new file called bedrock.js and paste in these lines of codes.\nexport function request(ctx) { const { ingredients = [], useFallback } = ctx.args; // Construct the prompt with the provided ingredients const prompt = `Suggest a recipe idea using these ingredients (Please provide a recipe with the language used in the input ingredients.

You can add as many Regional Models as you want. Therefore, if you want to specify the order of region models that will be used for the project, you can write like this:\n// Regional model as fallback `arn:aws:bedrock:\u0026lt;The primary local zone\u0026gt;::foundation-model/${regionalModelId}`, // Additional regions that might be used by cross-region inference `arn:aws:bedrock:\u0026lt;The following local zone\u0026gt;::foundation-model/${regionalModelId}`, `arn:aws:bedrock:\u0026lt;The following local zone\u0026gt;::foundation-model/${regionalModelId}`, `arn:aws:bedrock:\u0026lt;The following local zone\u0026gt;::foundation-model/${regionalModelId}`, `arn:aws:bedrock:\u0026lt;The following local zone\u0026gt;::foundation-model/${regionalModelId}`, … Or if you want to use all of the subscribed Regional Models, then you can write like this:\n`arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/${regionalModelId}`, In the bedrock.js file, you will see these lines:\nFor the ModelID: Since we are using cross-region which is different from the legacy, we will need to define the inference region profile before the agent model. Then it can automatically route between different local zone within the region we defined in the backend.ts file.\nFor the max_tokens: The maximum string output can a response generate. This will help us manage the estimation cost.\nFor the temperature: This is to dictate the randomness of a response.\nFor the type: This is to define the type of content it will deliver.\nFor the text: This is to generate a prompt to the agent model.\nFurthermore, to calculate the estimation cost of the service, we will need to access to the AWS Price Estimation website (https://aws.amazon.com/vi/bedrock/pricing/) and check on the company, the area and the model that you are using for the project.\nExample: Our project, which is located in the Asia Pacific region, developed by Anthropic and the model is Claude Sonnet 4, then you can calculate the price under this formula:\n(0.003 x (The number of input tokens) / 1000) + (0.015 x (The number of output tokens) / 1000)\n"

In order to do that, run open a new terminal window, navigate to workshop2 directory and run the following command:\nnpx ampx sandbox Once the cloud sandbox has been fully deployed, your terminal will display a confirmation message and the amplify_outputs.json file will be generated and added to your project.\n→If it says InvalidCredentialError: Failed to load default AWS credentials it means you need to configure your profile, in order to do that, type:\naws configure You can find the necessary information in the logged in session of your amplify-admin account by logging into the AWS Identity Center. Log into the Center and you will be able to find your code here.\nSo, once you click into the keys, you will be able to see the 3 options. Based on the operation you are running, choose the suitable one. In my case, it will be Windows.\nYou will be seeing the SSO and every info necessary for your SSO registration.\nRedo:\naws configure As for SSO session name and Profile name, please leave it at amplify-default. You can leave the SSO registration scopes and CLI default output format as blank.\nAfterward, type in:\naws configure sso You should see this in response:\nYou shall see the link. Click on it, and click on Allow Access.\nYou shall be greeted with this message.\nThen, in order to use your newly created profile, type in: npx ampx sandbox –profile amplify-default (or whatever your profile name is) The terminal will output this line “[Sandbox] Watching for file changes…” when success.\n→If it says SSMCredentialsError: UnrecognizedClientException: The security token included in the request is invalid, it might be due to a conflict amplify accounts, in order to fix this problem, navigate to C:\\Users\\YourUserName.aws and delete everything in there then start configure your profile as demonstrated above.\nFinally, to check the sso, you can use these commands.\naws sts get-caller-identity --profile amplify-1 npm ampx sandbox --profile amplify-1 When you’re done with setting up the sandbox environment, run:\nnpm run dev to initialize a localhost for your website, you can then get access to the website locally at locahost:5173.\nAfterwards, sign up and sign in using your account normally. Remember to verify your account as well.\nThe result should be:\n"
